REPORT FOR LESSON 4


Data columns should have predictive features. Otherwise we can drop that columns.

If columns have predictive features and have also missing values then we can fill them with particular values.

There are 3 types of filling missing values:

1: Mean()
2: Median()
3: Mode()
4: Fixed
5: Dropping


Mean() method is filling missing values with average of the column. For numerical data
Median() method is filling missing values with middle value of the column. For numerical data
Mode() method is filling missing values with the most frequent of the column. For categorical data
Fixed way of filling missing values with a constant value. can be both numerical and categorical
Dropping is used when column has too many NaNs.
