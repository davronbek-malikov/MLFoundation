There are 2 types of Supervised Machine Learning:

1: Classification 
2: Regression 

There are also 2 types of Classification tasks:

1: Binary [when number of classes equals 2]
2: Multiclass [when number of classes is more than 2]



Model development consists of 8 main steps:

1. Data collection
2. Data preprocessing
3. Model/Algorithm selection
4. Model training 
5. Evaluation 
6. Testing 
7. Deployment
8. Monitoring



2. Data preprocessing consists of 3 main steps:

1. data cleaning
2. encoding
3. scaling
