One-hot encoding is a way of encoding in which categorical data is turned into numerical data.
One-hot encoding is used when the class of a column is lower. For example, it can be up to 10. Otherwise dataset can be big.

we can find classes of columns with df.unique() 





Label encoding is a way to convert categorical values into numbers by assigning each category a unique integer.
When categories have natural order (ordinal data) we can use Label encoding.

| Size   |     
| ------ |
| Small  |
| Medium |
| Large  |

suppose we have above column that needs to be encoded with Label encoding:

Small  → 0  
Medium → 1  
Large  → 2
